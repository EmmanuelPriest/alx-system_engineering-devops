Firewall is a network security system that monitors and controls incoming and outgoing network traffic based on predetermined security rules.
It can be of two types:
Network-based system: this is a type that is positioned between two or more networks, typically between the local area network (LAN) and wide area network (WAN).
host-based system: this is a type that is deployed directly on the host itself to control network traffic or other computing resources.
